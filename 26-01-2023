1. We are given a transaction table that consists of transaction_id, user_id, transaction_date, product_id, and quantity.
We need to query the number of users who purchased products on multiple days(Note that a given user can purchase multiple products on a single day)

SELECT COUNT(user_id)
FROM
(
SELECT user_id
 FROM orders
 GROUP BY user_id
 HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT DATE(date)) > 1
) t1

2. We are given a subscription table which consists of subscription start and end date for each user.
We need to write a query that returns true/false for each user based on the overlapping of dates with other users. For instance,
If user1's subscription period overlaps with any other user the query must return True for user1.

SELECT *
FROM subscriptions AS s1
LEFT JOIN subscriptions AS s2
    ON s1.user_id != s2.user_id
        AND s1.start_date <= s2.end_date
        AND s1.end_date >= s2.start_date
